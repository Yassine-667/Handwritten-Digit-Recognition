# HandWritten Digit Recognition Classification
This project aims to classify handwritten digits using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project is the digits dataset from scikit-learn. Three different algorithms are used for classification: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The accuracy of each algorithm is measured using the accuracy_score function from scikit-learn's metrics module.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to install the following packages:

scikit-learn
matplotlib

These packages can be installed using pip:

pip install scikit-learn matplotlib

## Usage
To run the project, simply run the digit_recognition_classification.py file. The output will display the accuracy of each algorithm on the test set.

Note: If you encounter a ConvergenceWarning during the Logistic Regression classification, it is safe to ignore it.
